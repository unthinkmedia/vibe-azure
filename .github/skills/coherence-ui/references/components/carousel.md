## Guidance

### Standards

- You must meet the following requirements when using this component.

### Basic elements

- Title and description
- Content area
- Navigation buttons
- Steps to indicate and navigate place in carousel

### Navigation layout

- Flexible to edges
- Centered to steps
- Centered to content

### Navigation placement

- Outside the content area
- Inside and overlayed on the content area

### Content layout

- Carousels support a variety of layouts, ranging from one large content frame making up a single page in the carousel, to 3–4 content frames making up a page. Each have their own purposes.

### Content preview and alignment

A content preview can be added to the carousel to provide a peek at the content beyond the selected page. 


The content preview can be aligned based on reading order (left- or right-aligned), which would show the preview on one side of the active content. Or, it can be centered to the carousel itself, which would show previews on both the left and right sides of the active content.

### Image preview as steps

- In place of the circular carousel steps, when the carousel functions as an image slideshow, thumbnails previewing the images can be used to indicate each slide.

### Multiple carousels on a page

- Prioritize content between multiple carousels by giving one a unique layout. A carousel with a single, large content frame at the top will draw more attention to itself and can be used to highlight important information. Pairing it with carousels containing smaller content frames creates a clear visual hierarchy, naturally guiding people through the content in order of importance.

### Show all carousel items

- In scenarios where carousels make up a significant portion of the page UI, or where carousels contain more than 3–5 pages, people may prefer to browse all items at once with normal vertical scrolling. In those cases, a Show all link can be used, which would send people to a new page or drawer containing all carousel items in a stacked layout.
