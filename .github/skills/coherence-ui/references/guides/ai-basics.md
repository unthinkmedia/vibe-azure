AI basics
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is a model that can produce human-like content in response to user-entered prompts. This content can take various forms, including text, images, and code.


At Microsoft, AI is used to help people be more productive and creative by summarizing data, finding answers to questions, transcribing audio, taking notes, content writing, and much more. 


Build AI technology into your application by following our requirements and using our standardized components, layouts, and guidance.

Standards
You must meet the following requirements when using this component.
General requirements
Include fail safes to ensure the system is used appropriately.
Allow the person to control the AI, not the other way around.
Use clear and actionable language with Microsoft’s voice and tone.
Enable people to provide feedback.
Use the appropriate terminology when referring to AI.
Use the provided AI components.
Follow the specific requirements for the components that make up the AI experience.
Components
AI interfaces are made up of individual components that come together to create a robust user experience. Visit the articles below for detailed guidance, templates, and examples for each component.
AI chat
AI chat is an AI-powered conversational interface that respond to user-input and intelligently adapt to customer needs. This component primary component for Copilot and similar AI assistants.  Get AI chat guidance, templates, and code
Feedback for AI
Feedback for AI is a component that allows AI assistants such as Copilot to prompt for feedback from those using it. This qualitative feedback is used to improve their experience further.


Since the initial request for feedback comes from the application, this component is classified as system-initiated feedback.

Microfeedback
Microfeedback is a mechanism that allows someone to provide quick and easy feedback regarding AI behavior. This mechanism has tiers of qualitative feedback options available. 


Since the feedback process is started by the individual using the application, this component is classified as user-initiated feedback.

Content
Referring to AI
Customer-facing AI terminology should be used specifically and sparingly. In most cases, you can focus on the capability, benefit, and any risks without using AI terminology.


When an AI term is necessary, refer to the latest usage guidelines in the the Responsible AI Style Guide and Cloud + AI Style guide as terms may change.

Voice and style
Use Microsoft’s brand voice in all customer facing content including UI text.
Use bigger ideas, fewer words. Shorter is always better.
Be friendly and conversational. No. Robot. Words.
Project friendliness by using contractions: it’s, you’ll, you’re, we’re, let’s.
Get to the point fast by leading with what’s most important. 
Default to sentence-style capitalization—capitalize only the first word of a heading or phrase and any proper nouns or names. 
Skip end punctuation on titles, headings, subheads, UI titles, and items in a list that are three or fewer words. Save the periods for paragraphs and body copy. 
Best practices
When designing AI, ensure you are prioritizing these key requirements and asking the following questions.
Human needs first
Is this a problem people need solved?
Is AI the most suitable tool for addressing this problem?
Does this extend human capability, and does it provide insight and empowerment?
Not for harm
Could bad actors use this system in an unintended way?
Are the limitations of the system clear?
Do you have failsafes in place for situations where the AI cannot or should not respond / act?
Keep the person in control
Will this delight people and make it exciting to explore all the options and insights that generative AI offers?
Is training data as unbiased and representative as possible?
Have many people with diverse experiences provided input?
Clear and actionable
Does it fit Microsoft voice and tone?
Are responses still clear and natural when translated to other languages or formats?
Have you used outcome-focused language and prompt suggestions to help people shift their thought process from actions to the outcomes they want to achieve?
Continuous feedback
How are you enabling people to provide feedback to the AI?
Are you providing “gradients of answers” rather than binary ones (e.g. using a sliding scale for translating a doc into legal language, vs. providing two options - one legal one casual)?
How will your AI learn from and apply the feedback it receives?
Empowering, not just valuable
Are you designing not only for correctness and efficiency, but also for human preference and agency?
Are there multiple ways forward in any conversational interaction?
Have you ensured there are no dead ends and there are ways to undo?
Additional resources
Copilot and generative AI experiences undergo rapid evolution through an iterative design process. 


The following resources are emerging guidance, templates, and code created in response to customer needs. These latest design solutions may be subject to change.
