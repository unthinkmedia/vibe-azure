  "title": "Azure Cosmos DB Account Overview",
  "vision": "An Azure Cosmos DB account overview page featuring a request units (RU/s) consumption gauge, partition key distribution heat map, global distribution map showing read/write regions with latency indicators, a consistency level selector showing current vs. recommended settings, and a recent operations table with throughput and latency columns.",
  "problem": "Cosmos DB administrators need a single overview page to monitor RU consumption, understand partition hotspots, visualize global distribution and latencies, validate consistency settings, and review recent operation performance — currently scattered across multiple Azure portal blades.",
  "successCriteria": [
    "RU/s gauge with color-coded thresholds (warning/critical)",
    "Partition key heat map showing hot vs cold partitions",
    "Global distribution map with read/write region indicators and latency badges",
    "Consistency level selector comparing current vs recommended",
    "Recent operations table with sortable throughput (RU) and latency (ms) columns",
    "Standard Azure overview page layout with essentials panel, breadcrumb, side nav"
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Real API integration",
    "Interactive consistency level changes",
    "Real-time data updates"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Use Coherence UI components (cui-*) via @charm-ux/cui/react",
    "Follow Azure portal overview page conventions",
    "Single-page experiment in coherence-preview",
    "Use shared PageHeader and CopilotButton patterns"
