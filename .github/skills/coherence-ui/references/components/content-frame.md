## Guidance

### Standards

- You must meet the following requirements when using this component.

### Anatomy

- Space for content header (optional)
- Space for main content
- Space for inline drawer, on left or right side of content frame (optional)

### Responsiveness

- The content frame automatically adjusts based on the size of the window it sits in based on a set of standard snap points already included in the component.

### Use with the app frame

The content frame can be used without an app frame for simple and lightweight apps that may not require robust navigation components, like the side navigation. The header can still be used without the app frame and maintain its responsive behavior.


Apps with complex content that require nested pages can use the app frame to easily accommodate the side navigation. The content frame reflows according to the amount of screen available including what’s been taken up by the side navigation.

### Grid

Use a grid as an underlying structure that guides the placement of all elements on a page to help form a logical and organized layout. It also helps to define how elements rearrange on a page when designing at different screen sizes. While not required, a grid is a helpful tool when designing a page layout with the content frame.


More grid guidance is coming soon.
