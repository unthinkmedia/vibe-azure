## Guidance

### Top nav items (required)

- The active menu item in each nav indicates the page the reader is currently on. It is represented with a pressed state.

### Top nav menu (optional)

- Top navs can include dropdown menu items that nest subcategories.

### For narrower screens, the top nav condenses into a hamburger menu

- In smaller view ports like mobile size, this top nav menu expands to show subcategories in a navigation menu along with a back button showing parent category name.

### Separate top nav from pivots

- When using pivots with top nav, separate the components with another element so the reader recognizes the menu is global while the pivots pertain to that specific page.

### Use caution when placing breadcrumb and top nav together

- If breadcrumbs are necessary in the product’s experience, use a side nav instead of a top nav as your app can get complex and confusing to navigate.
