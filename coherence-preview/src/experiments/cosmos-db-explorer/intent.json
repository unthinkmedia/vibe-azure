  "title": "Cosmos DB Data Explorer",
  "vision": "An Azure Cosmos DB data explorer page that lets users browse databases, containers, and documents with inline JSON editing, query execution, and real-time throughput metrics.",
  "problem": "Developers need to quickly inspect and modify Cosmos DB documents without switching to the full Data Explorer app. A lightweight embedded explorer reduces context-switching and speeds up debugging workflows.",
  "successCriteria": [
    "Database and container tree navigation in a left sidebar",
    "Document list with sortable columns (id, partition key, timestamp)",
    "Inline JSON viewer/editor for selected documents",
    "Query bar with execute button and results table",
    "Throughput/RU usage sparkline chart in the header",
    "Pagination for large result sets"
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "No real Cosmos DB API integration — mock data only",
    "No cross-partition query support",
    "No stored procedures or triggers management"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must use Coherence components exclusively",
    "Desktop viewport only",
    "Single-page layout with resizable panels",
    "Mock data for all documents and metrics"
