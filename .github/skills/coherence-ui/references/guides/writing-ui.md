Writing for UI
Writing copy that’s part of the user interface (UI) design is both an art and science. Combining these copywriting best practices with visual design best practices will improve our users’ experiences.

Standards
Meet the following requirements when writing for UI.
General requirements
Focuses on usability and task completion.
Is concise.
Speaks in plain language.
Keeps reading levels no higher than grade 10.
Includes sentences of 25 words or less.
Promotes accessibility.
Tells people what they need to know when they need it.
Types of statements
How people react to and feel about your product depends partly on the quality of the writing and the overall voice and tone in which you speak. When writing in general, there are four types of statements that you can use. Typically, UI copy uses three of the four, depending on the nature of the product and the purpose of the copy.
Use frequently
Declarative
Use declarative statements regularly. A description of the features of a component is an example of when you’d use a declarative statement.


Example: This is how you write a declarative statement. It’s usually a statement of fact.
Imperative
Use imperatives freely. These are prompts and commands. For example, when asking the reader to review changes and then submit.


Example: Make sure you know the difference between imperative and declarative statements. 
Use sparingly
Interrogative
Interrogative statements are OK in product flows where people have to make choices and are natural in areas like support (e.g., FAQs). They can help clarify people’s needs and uncover solutions. 
Example: Did you know that an interrogative statement is just a question?
Exclamatory
Exclamatory statements end with exclamation marks. They express intense feelings (e.g., joy, anger, or excitement).. Occasionally, exclamatory statements can be used in UI copy. Just remember, the more you use them, the smaller the positive impact. 


Example: Way to go! You got it! 
Best practices
Keep important info up front
Start with the most important piece of info—the value proposition. Then, if there’s room and it’s necessary, add a brief paragraph or two with info in order of importance. If you need to say more, use a Read more link.

Be concise
Concise doesn’t mean limited; it means efficient. Use as few words as possible without losing the meaning. In the incorrect example below, the info provided might be valid, but may be unnecessary.
Correct example
Something went wrong
Check your connection. If the problem persists, contact customer support.
Incorrect example
There was an error with the app
Check your connection using the following steps:
Is your network cable plugged in?
Is your WiFi turned on and connected?
Is your modem turned on?
Contact customer support.
Make it scannable, task focused, and contextual 
When using a product, people aren’t interested in the features of the UI or being entertained by flowery language. They’re focused on task completion. Help them by writing in short, scannable blocks. Divide text into shorter sentences and paragraphs. Avoid overly gushy language.
Bite-sized chunks are easier to understand at a glance and create a natural flow.
Including information that's irrelevant to the reader or that distracts from their task adds to frustration and cognitive load.
Focusing on the reader, the action taken, or what they can expect next helps with task completion.
Use active and passive voice intentionally
In active voice, the subject performs the action. It starts with the person or thing that’s taking the action. In passive voice, the subject receives the action. The past participle of the action verb follows some form of the verb to be (e.g., has been, will be). For tasks and call-to-action labels, lean heavily into active voice. 
Correct
Use passive voice to focus on the action and result rather than who performed the action. E.g., The data was not saved. 
Correct
To give instructions, use active voice. State exactly what action needs to be taken. E.g., Start typing to search. 
Incorrect
Instructions written in passive voice are often less clear. E.g., A few letters should be entered to start searching. 


Use second person
Write as if speaking directly to the reader. Second person often uses the pronoun you. It supports a friendly, human tone and helps avoid passive voice by focusing on the reader. 
Correct
Make a connection with the reader by using you or your. And for more impact, omit the pronoun and accompanying auxiliary verbs (you can or you should) and start your sentence with a verb. 
Incorrect
Using first-person possessive phrasing like My dashboard while also labeling UI assets in second person (e.g., Plan your trip) increases cognitive load. 
Know when to focus on the reader
When it’s the product or app speaking, use we or Microsoft. This avoids confusion about who’s doing the talking or who should take action. For example, use We found these results, rather than I found these results.


The word we, which is first person, can help create a more human experience within the UI, but using it too much diverts attention from the reader and what they need to do.

To make your product more centered on the reader, consider using first person for systems errors and other system-related issues and in copy about the product or team. 
Correct
Take ownership of system or input errors to show people they're important every step of the way. E.g., We couldn’t find that file. Try searching for a different name.
Incorrect
People find failures frustrating regardless of who’s at fault. Never imply blame or accuse them. E.g, Your search was invalid. You entered the wrong information.
Put the benefit before the action or feature
Increase people’s ability to quickly complete tasks by explaining the benefit first. Describe what will happen if they take the action.


E.g., Continue where you left off. Save your changes before you go. 
Avoid double negatives
Double negatives increase cognitive load—they make people spend extra time decoding the message. 
Correct
Focus on positive actions clearly labeled.
Incorrect
Double negatives create confusion and affect task completion.
Use specific verbs whenever possible
Specific verbs are more meaningful to people than generic ones. 
Correct
Help people quickly understand available options or necessary actions by using specific words like get, update
, choose, or change. 
Incorrect
Avoid confusion and reduce ambiguity by eliminating words that have multiple meanings. 
Use consistent terminology
Use one word or phrase to refer to a specific action or thing across the experience every time. For example, if you call the process of securing a reservation booking in one place, don’t call it planning or scheduling somewhere else.


To help drive consistency, check word usage across Microsoft and then keep a term list that you and your team agree and adhere to. 
Avoid jargon and acronyms
Surveys have shown that even most software engineers prefer simple, non-technical language. It’s especially important to avoid jargon in error messages. It’s also important to remember that many common phrases are colloquialisms and may not be meaningful to everyone.


According to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide, only use acronyms people are familiar with.
Always write for the first-time user. Spell out acronyms on the first mention on each page and include the parenthetic reference. E.g., Commerce + Ecosystems (C+E).
If the spelled-out version of an acronym exceeds a character limit, consider writing around the phrase. 
Use the proper capitalization
Sentence casing means you only capitalize the first word in a sentence. Proper nouns—names of people, places, and some product names—also get capitalized. When in doubt, don't capitalize.
Title case
Use title case for names and titles of people (e.g., Hillary Ali, Software Engineer) places, Microsoft products, programs, and services unless it’s branded otherwise. For external organizations, use the appropriate brand label.
Sentence case
For page titles, headings, subheads, buttons, links, and other UI labels, use sentence case. 
Be polite—not overly ingratiating
People expect to be given prompts and to take action. Using please throughout the UI is unnecessary and comes across as amateurish. 
Correct
Use please and sorry sparingly, only when the task you’re asking is onerous, is your mistake, or has serious consequences. E.g., Something went wrong. Try reopening the dashboard.
Incorrect
It's never good practice to be rude, presumptuous, cocky, or cynical in UI copy. E.g., Something you did went wonky. No worries. We’ve got this.
Use contractions 
Use common contractions, such as it’s, you’re, that's, and don’t, to create a friendly, informal tone. Never use Microsoft in the possessive form, and avoid using it in a contraction. Avoid unpopular contractions such as there’d and what’re.
Common contractions
Use common contractions like can’t, don’t, it's, that’s, they’ll, they’re, we’re, won’t, you’ll, and you're.
When not to use contractions
Use the spelled-out version when the weight and importance of a message requires urgency. E.g., You are required to complete your security training by Nov 17, 2024.
Data formatting
Microsoft has specific formatting requirements for displaying data. This ensures data is consistent, legible, and clear. Adhere to Microsoft data formatting standards and abbreviate data according to guidance
, with special attention to localization requirements.


Begin calendars on Monday, which is the custom in much of the world.



Right-align dates and numbers in a column.
Abbreviate dates consistently
Dates are formatted with a two-digit date, three-letter abbreviation for the month, and a four-digit year. Abbreviate only when space is extremely tight. Don’t punctuate.
Month abbreviation
January – Jan
February – Feb
Marth – Mar
April – Apr
May – May
June – Jun
July – Jul
August – Aug
September – Sep
October – Oct
November – Nov
December – Dec
Time abbreviation
second – sec
minute – min
hour – hr
day – d
week – wk
month – mo
year – yr
US date format
For apps used only in the US, use the month, day, year format, which can be displayed in the following ways based on placement:


November 08, 2021
Nov 08, 2021
11/08/21
Global date format
For apps used in other parts of the world, use day, month, year.


08 November 2021
08 Nov 2021
08/11/2
Use common labels to time stamp events
If your app includes daily time stamps, events, and timelines, you may not need to include the entire date when there’s enough context to help situate people in time. Instead, use common labels like yesterday, today, and tomorrow for near-term events.


Omit the year when the timeframe for events is clear. E.g., Your connect is scheduled for May 12.
Express time in one of three ways
When it’s necessary to show the time, include the time period (AM or PM), capped and preceded by a space without punctuation. 


Use a 24-hour clock for all countries except: North America, UK, Egypt, India, the Philippines, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, and Australia.


The 12-hour clock: 9:30 AM, 1:00 PM  
The 24-hour clock: 9:30, 13:00
Military time: 930 hours, 1300 hours
Display time ranges correctly
For time ranges, if beginning and end times are both within the same period, show AM or PM after the end time. In content like invitations, event agendas, or course listings, use an en dash (–) with no space on either side in the time range. And don’t use from. 


E.g., Meeting with Michael 10–11 AM. 


When writing out a date, separate ranges in body text with the term to. 


E.g., The workshop runs from Mar 9, 2025 to Apr 9, 2025. 
Use the correct currency symbol or ISO currency code
Most often for comparative purposes, currencies are converted to Constant Dollars. This means that all currencies are translated into their USD value. This allows for a 1:1 view of actual values from one currency to the next.


Show the full number instead of rounding and abbreviating (e.g., 1,234,567 instead of 1.2M). Use a currency symbol (e.g., $) next to the amount to help distinguish between other numbers that may appear. 
When there are mixed currency types in your data grid that are distinct to each column, use a Constant Dollar value. Include the country ISO code to correctly label the country of origin.
If there are mixed types of currencies within the same column, use the appropriate country ISO code in front of the number to label the entry.
