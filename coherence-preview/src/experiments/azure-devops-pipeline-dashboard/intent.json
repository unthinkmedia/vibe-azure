  "title": "Azure DevOps Pipeline Dashboard",
  "vision": "Build an Azure DevOps Pipeline dashboard page that gives engineering teams a fast operational view of pipeline health, run trends, stage performance, and agent capacity.",
  "problem": "Teams lack a single at-a-glance Azure-style dashboard to monitor failing pipelines, run durations, flaky behavior, and agent pool saturation, which slows triage and release decisions.",
  "successCriteria": [
    "Shows pipeline health summary with pass/fail/in-progress counts and overall success-rate donut visualization",
    "Includes recent pipeline runs timeline with duration bars, status indicators, and commit message context",
    "Provides a Slowest Stages panel ranking longest-running pipeline stages with average durations",
    "Displays build agent pool utilization with online/offline/busy counts and utilization context",
    "Surfaces an alert banner for pipelines failing continuously for over 24 hours",
    "Includes Copilot suggestion prompts for failure diagnosis and flaky test investigation"
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "No live Azure DevOps API integration in this prototype",
    "No deep drill-in to individual pipeline definition pages"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Single Azure portal-style page prototype",
    "Use Coherence components and design tokens",
    "Use realistic mock data for pipelines, runs, stages, and agents"
