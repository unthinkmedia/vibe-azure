Illustration
Illustrations are thoughtfully integrated into the surface of the UI, as if they are a components of the page. They are generally smaller than images, but larger than icons. They spotlight key elements of the user experience, such as empty, error, and feature states, enhancing the text for a more engaging and intuitive interface. 


They are designed to be general purpose, reducing the volume of bespoke illustrations to gain design efficiency with a shared library.

Standards
You must meet the following requirements when using illustrations.
General requirements
Illustrations are kept to sizes of 128 pixels and above.
Illustrations are placed on neutral backgrounds (with token names such as Neutral/Background/1).
Illustrations are displayed fully. They’re never cropped or collaged.
Illustrations aren’t used in UI elements like buttons, but as decorative elements on a blank surface.
Illustrations are never customized in any way.
Accessibility requirements
Illustrations are never recolored.
Illustrations are shown with text that conveys the full meaning of the context it’s placed in.
Layout
Illustrations are paired with copy. In custom layouts using an illustration, a title is used above the illustration, with optional additional copy or a button below the illustration.


A component may sometimes come with text included, and the relevant copy can be placed in the provided text areas. 
Examples

A spot illustration is used in the main UI of the page, while a hero image is used as a full page background.

A spot illustration is used on the largest card on the page. Icons with a colored background surface are used in the smaller cards where less space is available.
