## Guidance

### Standards

- You must meet the following requirements when using this component.

### Anatomy

- Popover
- Persona
- Divider
- Link (article on Fluent 2 site)

### Layout

- The profile is accessed by interacting with the avatar in the header component.

### Customization options

- The profile can use up to three links, or none at all. The persona can hold up to four lines of text, with the first line always being the person’s name.

### Accessibility

Every component meets the Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS) requirements, which includes headings, keyboard navigation (focus order), screen readers (labels), color contrast, and more. Using our components and following the design standards will get you most of the way to an accessible experience that meets grade C.


To get you the rest of the way to grade C, you’ll need to ensure that experiences composed of multiple components are accessible. We recommend running Accessibility Insight's FastPass tool and manually testing your scenarios end to end with a keyboard and screen reader.
