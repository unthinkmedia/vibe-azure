## Guidance

### Standards

- You must meet the following requirements when using this component.

### Anatomy

- Section Title: Provides context as to the purpose of this specific unit within the form.
- Input components: These are the actual mechanisms utilized to collect information.
- Action button: Utilized to submit the contents of a form.

### Every input box needs a visual label

- That means that if there is a decision to split an input form into a few, each one has to have a corresponding label.

### Fields in a row have a logical connection

- Typically fields are stacked, but they can be arranged in rows if they hold related information, such as first and last names.

### Use status text to inform users of errors

- Inform users of input failures when filling in a form. If the user submits a form without noticing, or inline validation is not possible due to performance issues, provide a summary of the error messages in a message bar in addition to status error messages. The user should be able to quickly jump to the area with the error make corrections.

### Required and optional fields

- Mark required fields with an asterisk. Whether required or optional, only ask for information that provides legitimate value to the product or user experience.

### Don’t overload a form with disabled fields

- Consider alternative interaction such as progressive disclosure that guides users through the experience more efficiently.
