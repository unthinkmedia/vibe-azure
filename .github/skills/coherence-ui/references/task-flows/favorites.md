Favorites
The “add to favorites” interaction lets people mark items or resources they want to save or remember. Items added to favorites can then be grouped, sorted, and managed in other parts of the app. 
Standards
You must meet the following requirements when using this component.
General requirements
The filled star icon is used when an item is marked as favorited. 
The regular star icon is used when an item can be favorited, but hasn’t been marked as a favorite.
The words favorite or unfavorite aren’t used as verbs. “Add to favorites” or “Remove from favorites” are used instead.
When removing an item from favorites, the item stays present in the same position and available to favorite again until the reader navigates away from the page or adjusts the sort order. This allows the reader to reverse the action in the case of an accidental click. 
Accessibility requirements
When using the favorites button without text, include a tooltip that communicates the action.
Announcements are made when an item is being added or removed from favorites. Announcements can read, “Add [item name] to favorites” and “Remove [item name] from favorites.”
The outline only star icon is never yellow to maintain appropriate contrast ratios..
When the icon is placed on a non-white background, a neutral foreground color is used in place of yellow to maintain appropriate contrast ratios.

Layout
List item
The list item is designed to accommodate an icon button on the top right of the list item. The favorite interaction can either be placed as a single action there, or into an overflow menu.
Toolbar
In a toolbar, adding a favorite functions as any other button. Place the favorite button in order of priority. Consider and research how frequently your users might add an item to favorites compared to other available actions.
Content header
On an individual item page, the favorite icon can be placed right next to the title of the item. Most often, the icon-only interaction is most appropriate here as it takes up the least amount of space.
Data grid
Data grids can accommodate columns with action buttons. The favorites interaction can be placed in this column, and each item in the grid can be independently saved this way.
