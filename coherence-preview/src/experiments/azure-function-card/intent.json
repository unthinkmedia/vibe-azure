  "title": "Azure Functions Overview Page Exploration",
  "vision": "A modern Azure Functions overview page that surfaces function health, invocation trends, and recent failures at a glance — replacing the current flat list with a dashboard-style layout.",
  "problem": "Developers managing 20+ functions struggle to identify which ones need attention. The current list view requires clicking into each function individually.",
  "successCriteria": [
    "Shows aggregated health status per function app · Displays invocation sparklines for the last 24h · Highlights functions with error rate > 5% · Supports filtering by runtime and status"
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Real-time log streaming · Deployment management · Code editing"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must use Coherence components · Desktop viewport only · No backend API calls"
